Failed to acticate the indie license.

I have purchased one Indie license of ServiceStack.Text, 
but even I have registered it into my web project I still was prompted with "Free Quota Limited" exception.

I have tried all three ways of registration but no way worked.

Could you please give me some guide on how to make ServiceStack.Text workable on my development machine.

The environment is : Visual Studio 2012, ServiceStack version 4.0.23, NHibernate as my ORM
