## How to create a good Bug Report?

If your bug report is effective, chances are higher that it will get fixed. So fixing a bug depends on how 
effectively it's reported.

### 1) Reproducible:

If your bug is not reproducible it will never get fixed. You should clearly **provide the steps to reproduce the bug**. 
Do not assume or skip any reproducing step. A Step-by-step description of the issue is easy to reproduce and fix.
E.g. **A failing test** with the issue (or in a gist) is the preferred way to report a reproducible error as it contains 
all the assumptions and environment settings necessary for the error to occur. 

### 2) Be Specific:

Do not write a essay about the problem. Be Specific and to the point. Try to summarize the problem in minimum 
words yet in effective way. Do not combine multiple problems even they seem to be similar. 
Write different reports for each problem.

### 3) Environment Details:

Include the product and version of ServiceStack you're using, the Operating System and the versions of the relevant
major components, e.g. What .NET version, IIS Version, SQL Server version (if it's issue with OrmLite), etc.
